  <title>Quackhead - Duck Game Hat Pack Creation Tool - Instructions</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Quackhead Instructions</h3>
  <p>
    Quackhead will allow you to create hat packs without doing any coding at all!<br/>
    This page provides instructions detailing the process of creating a hat pack.
  </p>
  <h3>1. Understanding the hat images</h4>
  <p>
    The first step is to draw the hats, there are two different styles of hat you can use.<br/>
    The first of these is a 32x32 basic image, hats drawn with this template don't animate when you quack.<br/>
    The second option is to use a 64x32 image, this image will animate between two frames when you quack.<br/>
    You should download the correct template for the type of hat you wish to draw.<br/>
    Template 1: <img src="image/template1.png" /><br/>
    Template 2: <img src="image/template2.png" /><br/>
    Right click on the image and then "Save image as" to save the templates.<br/>
    You should draw your hats a layer in front of this template, and export them as transparent PNG files without the template layer.<br/>
    You probably won't be able to do this with MS Paint.<br/>
    I recommend Paint.NET if you are new to image editing, get it <a href="http://www.dotpdn.com/downloads/pdn.html">Here</a>. (The download page has ads that look like download links, so use adblock or be careful not to click them.)<br/>
  </p>
  <h3>2. Adding hats to your hat pack</h3>
  <p>
    When finished creating your hat textures, go to the quackhead webpage (<a href="quackhead.html">here</a>).<br/>
    Click "Add Team" and select the png files you created<br/>
    For each team type a team name.
  </p>
  <h3>3. Exporting as .hat files</h3>
  <p>
    Hat files will allow you to use your hats in multiplayer games. Everyone will be able to see your hat, without any mod being needed!<br/>
    They are, however, not "official". So if you have problems, try removing them before anything else.<br/>
    Click "Export as .hat files" at the top.<br/>
    Extract the .hat files from the zip, if you downloaded more than one.<br/>
    Move the downloaded .hat files into your duck game folder, this is usually at something like<br/>
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Duck Game\<br/>
    Then start duck game, your hats should be in your hat selector.<br/>
    All the other steps pertain to exporting as a mod pack, if you want to do that.
  </p>
  <h3>4. Exporting as a Mod Pack</h3>
  <p>
    Mod packs allow people using the mod to wear the hat, but currently they can ONLY play with other people using the mod.<br/>
    You may not want to use this unless you have a group of people who will play using your mod.<br/>
    Click "Export as Modpack" at the top.<br/>
    Fill in the following fields, described below:<br/>
    "Name" - Unique Name for your mod<br/>
    "Description" - One line description of your mod<br/>
    "Author" - Name / Username of the mod creator<br/>
    "Version" - Must be a number, describes the version of your mod.<br/>
    Once done, click "Download Exported Modpack"
  </p>
  <h3>5. Testing your mod pack</h3>
  <p>
    Open the .zip file, and copy the folder inside to your Documents/Duck Game/Mods folder</br>
    Start duck game, and as soon as you can, try to change your hat. Check that your new hats work correctly.<br/>
    Be aware that with mod packs, you can ONLY play with people that have the exact same combination of mod packs<br/>
    If you have problems, you can remove the mod from your Mods folder to get things back to normal.<br/>
  </p>
  <h3>6. Adding a thumbnail</h3>
  <p>
    (this step is completely optional, but recommended)<br/>
    The thumbnail is a square image that will be shown on the workshop and mod browser.<br/>
    Create a 256x256 png file and name it "preview.png", put it in the "content" folder inside the mod directory.
  </p>
  <h3>7. Publishing</h3>
  <p>
    You can publish your mod so other people can use it. In the settings page, go to "Manage Mods".<br/>
    From there, you can publish your mod.
